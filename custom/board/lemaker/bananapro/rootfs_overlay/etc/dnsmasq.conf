# Only listen to routers' LAN NIC.  Doing so opens up tcp/udp port 53 to
# localhost and udp port 67 to world:
interface=eth0

# dnsmasq will open tcp/udp port 53 and udp port 67 to world to help with
# dynamic interfaces (assigning dynamic ips). Dnsmasq will discard world
# requests to them, but the paranoid might like to close them and let the 
# kernel handle them:
bind-interfaces

# Optionally set a domain name
domain=zzeroo.lan

# Set default gateway
dhcp-option=3,192.168.8.1

# Set DNS servers to announce
dhcp-option=6,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4

# If your dnsmasq server is also doing the routing for your network,
# you can use option 121 to push a static route out.
# x.x.x.x is the destination LAN, yy is the CIDR notation (usually /24), 
# and z.z.z.z is the host which will do the routing.
#dhcp-option=121,x.x.x.x/yy,z.z.z.z

# Dynamic range of IPs to make available to LAN PC and the lease time. 
# Ideally set the lease time to 5m only at first to test everything works okay before you set long-lasting records.
dhcp-range=192.168.8.50,192.168.8.200,5m

# Provide IPv6 DHCP leases through Router Advertisements (RAs) for aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd::/64 subnet
#dhcp-range=aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd::,ra-only,infinite

# If youâ€™d like to have dnsmasq assign static IPs to some clients, bind the LAN computers
# NIC MAC addresses:
#dhcp-host=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff,192.168.111.50
#dhcp-host=aa:bb:cc:ff:dd:ee,192.168.111.51
